# Something - the JavaX clicker game!
This was done as a project for programming class. Of course, this was the best project.

## How to run
From the releases page, download the latest .jar file.  
Once downloaded, open your terminal in the folder where the file is located.  
Run "java -jar clicker.jar".  
Enjoy the garbage fire :)
